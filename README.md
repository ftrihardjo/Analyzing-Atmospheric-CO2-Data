# Analyzing Atmospheric CO2 Data

## The Importance of Monitoring CO2 Levels
1. Climate Change Mitigation: Tracking CO2 concentrations helps inform policies and strategies to reduce emissions and mitigate climate change impacts.
2. Environmental Impact: CO2 influences plant growth, ocean acidification, and ecosystem health.
3. Indoor Air Quality: High CO2 levels indoors can affect human comfort, productivity, and health.
4. Regulatory Compliance: Many regions have regulations or targets for CO2 emissions reduction.
5. Scientific Research: Monitoring CO2 aids climate modeling, carbon cycle studies, and understanding atmospheric dynamics.

## Dataset
The dataset used is from [IEA-EDGAR CO2](edgar.jrc.ec.europa.eu/dataset_ghg2024) sheet IPCC 2006. It contains information on the monthly amount of CO2 emission from 1970 to 2023 for every country by different emission sources.

## Analysis
Based on the graph of the monthly mean CO2 levels from January 2013 to December 2022, it decreases at the start of the year, plateaus in May, and then increases in September, reaching the same monthly mean CO2 levels as at the beginning of the year in December.

## Insights into potential impacts of rising CO2 levels on climate change
### Key Climate Impacts of Rising CO₂
1. Global Temperature Rise
- CO₂ traps heat in the atmosphere, intensifying the greenhouse effect.
- Since pre-industrial times, CO₂ levels have surged by over 50%, reaching 428 ppm in July 2025.
- This has led to more frequent and intense heatwaves, droughts, and wildfires.
2. Ocean Acidification
- Oceans absorb about 25–30% of emitted CO₂, which reacts with seawater to form carbonic acid.
- This has lowered ocean pH by 0.1 units, a 30% increase in acidity, threatening coral reefs and shell-forming marine life.
3. Extreme Weather Events
- Elevated CO₂ contributes to stronger El Niño cycles, which disrupt global weather patterns.
- These events reduce plant growth and increase forest fires, further accelerating CO₂ emissions.
4. Melting Ice and Sea Level Rise
- Polar ice sheets and glaciers are melting faster due to warming, raising sea levels and threatening coastal communities.
- Feedback loops (e.g., less ice = less sunlight reflected) amplify warming.
5. Ecosystem Disruption
- Shifts in temperature and precipitation patterns affect biodiversity, crop yields, and water availability.
- Some species may migrate or go extinct, while others (like pests) may thrive.
### Mitigation Strategies in Motion
1. Carbon Capture and Storage (CCS): Technologies that trap CO₂ from industrial sources and store it underground.
2. Sustainable Agriculture: Reducing methane emissions from livestock and rice farming, and adopting climate-smart practices.
3. Renewable Energy & Efficiency: Transitioning from fossil fuels to solar, wind, and other clean sources.
